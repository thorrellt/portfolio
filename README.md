Welcome to the repo for thorrellt.com. This is written in HTML, CSS, & JS with a little JQuery.

## Key Takeaways

**SCSS** First time using SCSS to write more organized & maintainable code. I was able to learn and utilize a lot of the core concepts and features SCSS provides.   

**Layouts** I was able to strengthen my familiarity with CSS layouts & display properties because this project did not use any CSS frameworks.  

**DOM Manipulation** Since this project did not use any JS framework, it helped me build upon my JS knowledge & ability to interact with DOM.  

## As I Continue to Improve Upon This Page, 
#### I plan to...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..update the logic behind the layout to gain more control/precision in regards to the page's responsiveness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..update the design & color scheme. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..make the page more dynamic by implementing a back-end for increased maintainability as the page interates & grows.
